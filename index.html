            <p>Pizzetta is a small version of pizza that varies in size and shape, so some pizzettas can even be prepared in the shape of a heart. It is made in the same way as a regular, large pizza, consisting of a dough base (or puff pastry) topped with sauces, cheeses, and various additional ingredients.

                The dish is usually served as an appetizer, a quick snack, or a light meal. In Rome's bakeries, pizzette are often sold by weight, and if you order an apéritif at a café, you might even get a complimentary pizzetta with your order.</p>

            <p>Paella is perhaps the most famous Spanish dish of all, and certainly one of the most abused. Authentic paella originates from the region around Valencia, and comes in two varieties: Paella Valenciana, with rabbit and chicken; and seafood paella.

                Saffron gives the rice its color, and the base should be left to crisp into a mouth-watering black crust, called the socarrat. Always eaten at lunchtime.</p>
